New Spell
Thunderwave
Page Number: 283
1-Level Evocation
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: Self (15-foot cube)
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
A wave o f thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each
creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10
feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely
within the area o f effect are automatically pushed 10 feet
away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a
thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

spell slot o f 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

New Spell
Detect Thoughts
Page Number: 231
2-Level Divination
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts o f certain
creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of
you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature
is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts o f the
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your attention to another
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the
same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and something that looms large in its mind (such as
something it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course o f its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part o f an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of
thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the
spell or as your action during the duration, you can
search for thoughts within 30 feet o f you. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet o f rock, 2 inches o f any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet o f lead blocks you.
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence o f 3 or
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
Once you detect the presence o f a creature in this way,
you can read its thoughts for the rest o f the duration as
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still
be within range.

spell slot o f 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial
and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
