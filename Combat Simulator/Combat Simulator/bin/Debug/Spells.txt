This spell is a minor m agical trick that novice

creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you
learn its school o f magic, if any.

by 1 foot o f stone, 1 inch o f common metal, a thin sheet
of lead, or 3 feet o f wood or dirt.

New Spell

New Spell
Thunderwave
Page Number: 283
1-Level Evocation
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: Self (15-foot cube)
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
A wave o f thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each
creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10
feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely
within the area o f effect are automatically pushed 10 feet
away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a
thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot o f 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

New Spell
Detect Thoughts
Page Number: 231
2-Level Divination
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts o f certain
creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of
you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature
is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts o f the
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your attention to another
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the
same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and something that looms large in its mind (such as
something it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course o f its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part o f an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of
thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the
spell or as your action during the duration, you can
search for thoughts within 30 feet o f you. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet o f rock, 2 inches o f any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet o f lead blocks you.
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence o f 3 or
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
Once you detect the presence o f a creature in this way,
you can read its thoughts for the rest o f the duration as
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still
be within range.

splashes the target with acid for half as much o f the
initial damage and no damage at the end o f its next turn.

spell slot o f 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial
and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

Mirror Image
Page Number: 260
2-Level Illusion
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates o f yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s
impossible to track which image is real. You can use
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during
the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the
attack instead targets one o f your duplicates.
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or
higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends
when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it
relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or
if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

or enters the w arded area. When you cast the spell, you
can designate creatures that w on’t set off the alarm. You
also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind

coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a member o f another

instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you
can use your action to change your appearance in
this way again.
Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural w eapon o f your choice. Your
unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or

strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you
have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
make using it.

Animal Messenger

2-Level Enchantment (ritual)
Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: 30 Feet
Components: V
Duration: 24 hours
By means o f this spell, you use an animal to deliver a
message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range,
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
who matches a general description, such as “a man or
woman dressed in the uniform o f the town guard” or “a
red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak
a message o f up to twenty-five words. The target beast
travels for the duration o f the spell toward the specified
location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a
flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.
When the messenger arrives, it delivers your m essage
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound
o f your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature
matching the description you gave. If the messenger
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to
where you cast this spell.

Cast Time: 1 Action
Range: 30 Feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, Up to 24 hours
Your m agic turns others into beasts. Choose any
number o f willing creatures that you can see within
range. You transform each target into the form o f a
Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating o f 4 or
lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
You can choose a different form for each target. A
target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics o f
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
target assumes the hit points o f its new form, and when
it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number
o f hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is
limited in the actions it can perform by the nature o f its
new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any o f
its equipment.

New Spell

3-Level Necromancy
Cast Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
o f bones or a corpse o f a Medium or Small humanoid
within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul
mimicry o f life, raising it as an undead creature. The
target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s
game statistics).
On each o f your turns, you can use a bonus action
to mentally command any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet o f you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
o f them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). You decide what action the creature will take
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given
it. To maintain control o f the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use o f the spell reasserts your control over up to four
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot o f 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
control over two additional undead creatures for each
slot level above 3rd. Each o f the creatures must come
from a different corpse or pile o f bones.

creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet o f you (if you control multiple creatures,
you can command any or all o f them at the same time,
issuing the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature w ill take and where it will
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general
command, such as to guard a particular chamber or

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points,
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom
are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
locomotion, it instead has a flying speed o f 30 feet and
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius o f 30 feet and
is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its
original object form.
If you command an object to attack, it can make a
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet
o f it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
piercing damage based on its form.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a
spell slot o f 6th level or higher, you can animate two
additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

New Spell
Antipathy/Sympathy
Page Number: 214
8-Level Enchantment
Cast Time: 1 Hour
Range: 60 Feet
Components: V
Duration: 10 days
This spell attracts or repels creatures o f your choice.
You target something within range, either a Huge or
smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind o f intelligent
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures o f the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
see the target or comes within 60 feet o f it, the creature
must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or b ecome
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
by the target, the creature must use its movement to
move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see
the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from
the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer
frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if
it regains sight o f the target or moves within 60 feet o f it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet o f it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet o f it,
the creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or
use its movement on each o f its turns to enter the area
or move within reach o f the target. When the creature
has done so, it can’t w illingly m ove away from the target.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected
creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet o f the target or able to see
it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
the target and recognizes the feeling o f repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every
24 hours while the spell persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect
is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.

The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane
o f existence. A solid barrier b locks the eye’s movement,
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1
inch in diameter.

6-Level Conjuration
Cast Time: 1 Action

Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open
for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that
you can see, one point within 10 feet o f you and one
point within 500 feet o f you. A circular portal, 10 feet
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
and the casting is lost.
The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and
perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
faces in a different direction.

Tendrils o f dark energy erupt from you and batter all
creatures within 10 feet o f you. Each creature in that

reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the
creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

New Spell
Astral Projection
Page Number: 215
9-Level Necromancy
Cast Time: 1 Hour
Range: 10 Feet
Components: V
Duration: Special
You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious and in a state o f suspended animation; it
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
Your astral body resembles your m ortal form in
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions. The principal difference is the addition o f
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when
you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one o f your
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its
state o f suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
companions remain in their astral forms and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to 0 hit points.

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones,
laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
entity about the results o f a specific course o f action that
you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM
chooses from the following possible omens:
• Weal, for good results
• Woe, for bad results
• Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
• Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting o f additional spells or the loss or gain
o f a companion.
If you cast the spell two or more times before
completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
percent chance for each casting after the first that you
get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
